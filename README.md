# Wheelchair Object Detection

## Overview
For wheelchair users, especially power wheelchair users, it can be hard to see what's behind the chair, especially when backing up or turning, which can be dangerous because there is a high potential to hit an object or person. The aim of this project is to solve that problem by creating a low-cost device that can detect obstacles and warn the wheelchair user so they don't hit objects or people, similar to how a car has object detection when backing up. 

## Materials

### Microcontroller
[Arduino MEGA 2560 Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3): Arduino boards are low cost and are programmed in C++, which makes it easy to use for this project. 

### Sensors
[2 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569): Ultrasonic sensors are pretty accurate and have a large range. 1 of the sensors is used to detect objects when backing up, and the other one is to detect objects while turning.

### Display
[Mini OLED Display](https://www.amazon.com/UCTRONICS-SSD1306-Self-Luminous-Display-Raspberry/dp/B072Q2X2LL/ref=sr_1_3keywords=0.96+arduino+display&qid=1639941936&sr=8-3): This bright display is useful to clearly display the distance from the object.
